Hello! I am writing this particular page from scratch. My intent is to apply the
code that I have learned recently. That way I can actively use it and keep applying
newly-learned code. 

I figure the best way to start building is just to jump in after learning a bit, so here I am.
This repo may go somewhere, it may go nowhere, but I am going to try to build on it and
turn it into something cool.

The text on the webpage is not meant to make any sense. It is placeholder text.
I plan on updating it to something later :).
